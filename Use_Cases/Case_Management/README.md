# Manage Salesforce Cases

NOT DONE YET

## Instructions
- Page API:  V1
- Data source: Uses default Salesforce data source
- Design system: [Download this Design System file](Salesforce_Demo.designsystem), and use the Import function on the Design System page to add this system to your org. 
- Page XML:  [Copy the XML from this page](Account_Hierarchy.xml), or save it as an XML file, and upload it as a new page in your Salesforce Org.  

## Notes

- The chart allows you to drill down into the underlying Opportunity data and make changes if necessary.
- The KPIs are Skuid UI Only Formula fields - so you do not need to worry about using up any of your roll-summary fields on your Account Object.
- The Modal that appears when clicking "New Case" is completely configurable and no code was necessary - it's one of the many actions available to call from Skuid's Action Framework ("Show Modal")
- You can style buttons and place them anywhere on the page, highly configurable and powerful components that hook into the Action Framework and/or Salesforce actions (approval process, Apex, etc.).
